# ForecastSkill

A Claude Skill that provides real-time weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## ⚠️ Network Requirements

**Important**: This skill requires HTTPS network access to `api.openweathermap.org`. 

Some Claude environments may need this domain added to their allowed network list. If you encounter connection errors, you may need to:
- Update your Claude environment's network settings to allow `api.openweathermap.org`
- Contact your administrator if you're in a restricted environment

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
3. Run the build script and enter your API key when prompted:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `./build.sh`
   - **Windows**: `.\build.ps1`
4. Upload the generated zip to Claude.

### Build Script Options

**Bash (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
./build.sh                          # Interactive: prompts for API key
./build.sh your_api_key_here        # Non-interactive: uses provided key
./build.sh your_key custom-name.zip # Custom output filename
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
.\build.ps1                               # Interactive: prompts for API key
.\build.ps1 -ApiKey your_api_key_here     # Non-interactive: uses provided key
.\build.ps1 -ApiKey your_key -OutputName custom-name.zip # Custom output filename
```

Both build scripts will:
- Inject your API key into config.json
- Create a zip with files at the top level (no subfolders)
- Validate the bundle structure
- Ready for immediate upload to Claude

## Usage

Ask Claude weather questions and the skill automatically activates:

**Single Location Weather:**
- "What's the weather like in Paris tomorrow?"
- "Will it rain in Seattle this weekend?"
- "Should I bring a jacket to Denver next week?"

**Multi-Location Comparison:** 
- "Compare weather in Paris vs London next week"
- "Which city has better weather this week, Berlin or Amsterdam?"
- "Paris or Rome for a 5-day trip?"

**Activity Recommendations:**
- "Is it good weather for skiing in Colorado this week?"
- "When should I plan a picnic in Central Park?"
- "What are the best days for hiking in Portland?"
- "Should I water my garden tomorrow?"

Supported activities: skiing, picnic, hiking, gardening, beach, cycling, plus many other outdoor activities

### Local Testing

**Current Weather:**
```bash
cd forecast_skill
python skills/get_weather.py current "London"
```

**Weather Forecast:**
```bash
python skills/get_weather.py forecast "London" 5
```

**Compare Locations:**
```bash
python skills/get_weather.py compare "Paris" "London" 7
```

**Activity Recommendations:**
```bash
python skills/get_weather.py activity skiing "Denver, Colorado" 5
```

**Legacy Format (still supported):**
```bash
python skills/get_weather.py "London" "2025-11-12"
```

## Troubleshooting

**"missing_api_key" error**: 
- Edit `config.json` and add your OpenWeatherMap API key
- Make sure you replaced the placeholder text

**"invalid_api_key" error**: 
- Verify your API key at https://openweathermap.org/api
- Check for extra spaces or quotes in config.json

**"location_not_found" error**: 
- Try a more specific location name
- Use format like "Paris, France" instead of just "Paris"

**"unknown_activity" error**:
- The system now supports many outdoor activities beyond the core list
- If an activity isn't recognized, it will default to general outdoor activity analysis
- Try using more descriptive terms if you get unexpected results

**Network domain restrictions**:
- Claude environments may need `api.openweathermap.org` added to allowed network domains
- If you get network/connection errors, check your Claude environment's network settings
- This skill requires external API access to function properly
