=====
Once uploaded, you can ask Claude weather questions like:
- "What's the weather in Tokyo tomorrow?"
- "Will it rain in London this weekend?"
- "Should I bring a jacket to Seattle next week?"

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
If the skill doesn't work:
- Check that you replaced the placeholder in config.json with your actual API key
- Verify your API key is valid at https://openweathermap.org/api
- Make sure you didn't add extra quotes or spaces around the key

Need help? Check that your config.json looks like this:
{"api_key": "your_actual_key_here"}

NOT like this:
{"api_key": ""PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE""}  ← Wrong (extra quotes)
{"api_key": " your_key_with_spaces "}     ← Wrong (extra spaces)
